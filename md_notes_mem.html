<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md17"></a>
Overview of memory access</h1>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md18"></a>
Addressing modes</h2>
<p>x86 has 16-bit, 32-bit, and 64-bit addressing modes. These don't exactly correspond with the active CPU mode ((16-bit) real mode can use 32-bit registers and addressing, for example). The addressing mode restricts how you can address memory (e.g., which registers can be used as a base address, and operand sizes) and is encoded into the instruction/asm instruction.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md19"></a>
Real mode</h2>
<p>x86 computers start in i8086 mode. Each memory access involves one of the segment registers plus an offset. The segment register is usually implicit (cs for code, ds for data, and ss for stack) but can usually be explicitly specified. (segment:offset) pairs are translated into the physical address (segment*0x10 + offset).</p>
<p>This segmentation method exists historically to extend a 16-bit address space into a 20-bit one (and still exists for backcompat reasons), and it comes with many complications (e.g., the A20 line). For the sake of this toy project, all segment registers are forced to 0 in real mode.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md20"></a>
Protected mode</h2>
<p>In protected mode, we still have "segmentation" (i.e., the segment registers still exist and have meaning), although in a different way. Segments are described by the Global Descriptor Table (GDT) (and some other related tables, e.g., the LDT, IDT, TSS), and the segment registers are only used to select a segment. Segments contain a base and a limit, some permissions fields, and can be 16-, 32-, or 64-bit.</p>
<p>For the most part, segmentation has been superceded by a different virtual memory method called paging. I say "for the most part" because segmentation still exists and is implemented in x86 to translate segment:offset into virtual addresses (which then get translated to physical addresses via paging if enabled). Nowadays the GDT mapping is almost always trivial (offset=0, limit=max) so that paging is the only memory mapping mechanism.</p>
<p>Paging is a fairly complicated, hierarchical memory mapping scheme that requires hardware support, so I'm not going to go into it. Additionally, there's differences between 32-bit and 64-bit paging (PAE, 4-level vs. 5-level paging, and hugepages make this even more complicated). Both the OSDev wiki and the Intel SDM are great resources.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md21"></a>
Paging strategy</h1>
<p>In x86_64, the virtual address space (48 for 4-level paging or 57 bit for 5-level) is usually larger than the physical address space (52 bit) which is vastly larger than the actual physical memory for many machines (~30-40 bit). This means that we can easily map the entirety of physical memory into some part of virtual memory, so the kernel can address any byte in memory (plus some offset). This usually lives at the start of higher-half memory (0xFFFF800000000000 assuming 4-level paging) and is referred to as the <em>higher half direct map</em>.</p>
<p>In 32-bit x86, we're a little less lucky. It's very possible for the physical memory to take up the entirety of the addressable space (4GB), so we can't fit the entire physical memory into the higher half. PAE makes this even worse, since it allows a physical address space (36 bits) larger than the virtual address space.</p>
<p>It's a good idea to keep all kernel virtual addresses in the higher half, so it's fine to just map enough space for the kernel. If the "higher half" starts at 0xC0000000 (leaving us 1GB of virtual address space for the kernel), we can linearly map the first 1GB of memory. The limitations of this are: (1) the kernel cannot address memory outside the first GB of physical memory (unless it maps those pages manually) and (2) userspace only gets 3GB of addressible memory. We don't have to prevent userspace processes from allocating page frames from the first 1GB of physical memory, but these will need to be evicted/paged out if the kernel is running low on memory, or the kernel will need to manually map (low) memory for its own use. The kernel will remain fixed for all userspace processes. <a href="https://forum.osdev.org/viewtopic.php?p=312121#p312121">Here's</a> a good description of this paging strategy.</p>
<p><a class="el" href="classA.html">A</a> different approach is to identity-map the entire 32-bit address space for the kernel, and maintain a completely separate address space for userspace, but <a href="https://forum.osdev.org/viewtopic.php?p=312122&amp;sid=a6ce91a6afd755945b629cd7678ab6e8#p312122">this complicates things</a>.</p>
<p>Note that the kernel also needs to be loaded at a fixed address in high memory. For simplicity I choose this to be a region of hardcoded size (starting at <code>KERNEL_LOAD_ADDR</code>) at the top of the virtual address space. This will eat away from the 1GB HHDM, but the kernel size should be much smaller than 1GB.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md22"></a>
General kernel memory usage</h1>
<p>Just to get a sense of what takes space in the kernel:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Text/data region</em>: The actual kernel code. In the case of this toy project, this is negligible.</li>
<li><em>Page tables</em>: For 2-level (non-PAE) x86, the memory usage can be as low as 4 bytes per page, or 1/1024 of the mapped address space. This ratio will be higher if userspace processes have sparse page tables.</li>
<li><em>Page frame array</em>: If we copy Linux and use 64 bytes of metadata per page frame, this is probably the largest component of kernel memory, taking 1/64 of the physical memory. For 4GB of physical memory, this means 64MB dedicated to the page frame array.</li>
<li><em>Kernel stacks</em>: There will be one one-page page frame per kernel- or userspace process.</li>
</ul>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md23"></a>
Paging extensions</h1>
<p>All of the paging extensions can be queried via the <code>cpuid</code> instruction.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md24"></a>
x86</h2>
<p>The standard paging involves a two-tier hierarchy. <em>Page tables</em> comprise 1024 4KB pages, and <em>page directories</em> comprise 1024 page tables (4MB).</p>
<p>These paging extensions do not increase the virtual address space (which cannot be extended past 32 bits). PSE-36 and PAE extend the physical address space to 36 bits.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Page size extension</em> (PSE) enables 4MB huge pages in the page directory. These page directory entries point to 4MB pages rather than page tables.</li>
<li><em>PSE-36</em> enables 36-bit physical addresses via a modified page table structure. It still uses the two-hierarchy page table structure (and is thus simpler than PAE). However, it only allows huge pages for addresses above 4GB. This was a stopgap measure before PAE was introduced, and PAE is considered a better solution now.</li>
<li><em>Physical address extension</em> (PAE) sets up 3-level paging with 8-byte page table entries (512 entries per page). The page table addresses 512 pages (2MB), the page directory 512 page tables (1GB), and the new <em>page directory pointer table</em> (terrible name, I know) contains 512 page directories (512GB). This theoretically enables up to 12+9+9+9=39 bits of physical address space, but usually only 36 bits of physical address space were allowed/implemented, same as PSE-36.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Page attribute table</em> (PAT) is another 3-letter acronym starting with 'P' that relates to paging. I'm not going to go into this.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md25"></a>
x86-64</h2>
<p>The standard 64-bit paging involves a four-tier hierarchy, based on PAE. One additional level (the <em>page map level 4</em>, or PML4) was added. This extends the physical address space to 48 bits (256TB).</p>
<p>However, this physical address space isn't enough even for some large-scale servers, so another page table level (<em>PML5</em>) was added to support up to 57 bits (128PB) of virtual address space. This is (as of the time of wrting) a pretty new feature (only supported by Intel Ice Lake/AMD Ryzen 7000 and newer).</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md26"></a>
Kernel memory management</h1>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md27"></a>
Physical memory management</h2>
<p>There are two levels of physical memory allocation: page frames and smaller chunks.</p>
<p>Firstly, we need a <code>page frame table</code>, which is an array of <code>page frame descriptors</code>s. There exists one page frame descriptor for each page frame (4KB physical page) in RAM. This stores metadata about the page frame and easily is the kernel's largest data structure (in Linux this has an overhead of 1/64 of the total installed RAM).</p>
<p>After the page frame table is initialized, we need a <code>page frame allocator</code>. This should provide a very simple interface: </p><div class="fragment"><div class="line">void *alloc_page_frames(int num_page_frames);</div>
<div class="line">void free_page_frames(void *start, int num_page_frames);</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p> There are <a href="https://wiki.osdev.org/Page_Frame_Allocation">multiple common approaches to this</a>, from being as simple as a linear scan over an auxiliary bitmap, using a stack data structure to keep track of freepages for fast allocation/freeing, and using multiple bitmaps ("buddy allocator") for fast allocation of different sizes of contiguous memory.</p>
<p>Once we have the ability to allocate kernel pages, there should be a mechanism to allocate smaller pieces of memory to allow for <code>kmalloc()</code>/<code>kfree()</code>-like functionality. This probably means some sort of slab allocator (e.g., Linux has different slab allocator implementations called SLAB/SLUB/SLOB).</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md28"></a>
Virtual memory management</h2>
<p>This is mostly relevant for userspace, since we'll be using the linear HHDM for kernel purposes. (For now, it's simplest if we use this 3GB/1GB as a hard division of userspace/kernel code, but later we can be more lenient and allow userspace to allocate from the low 1GB if needed.)</p>
<p>Virtual memory will be managed via <code>demand paging</code> (i.e. lazily). Upon a <code>mmap()</code> request, the new <code>virtual memory area</code> (VMA) will be added to the processes' VMA list. The actual page(s) will be mapped in upon a page fault, which will first check that the memory is valid (in the VMA) before allocating a physical page and performing the virtual memory mapping.</p>
<p>Upon a userspace process exit, all physical pages mapped to that process will be freed. The virtual mappings will automatically get discarded once the process's page mapping is discarded (this should also be included in the set of physical pages mapped to that process). </p>
