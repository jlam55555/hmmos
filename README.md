# HmmOS
Second attempt at writing an OS, this time a little more from scratch
now that I have a slightly better idea of what the bootloader does.

Focusing on x86 first, will maybe update this to be for x86_64 later.

## Setup
This project is mainly built with clang/LLVM toolchains in mind. This
includes `clang`, `lld`, `clangd`, and `clang-format`. You'll need at
least version 14.

GNU `binutils` is needed where LLVM is lacking (i.e. `as` for GNU AT&T
asm syntax + `objdump` and friends). GNU `mtools` is also required to
build the binary.

This will be tested with `qemu` with QEMU and KVM emulation.

Versions:
```

$ uname -a
Linux jebian 6.1.0-27-amd64 #1 SMP PREEMPT_DYNAMIC Debian 6.1.115-1 (2024-11-01) x86_64 GNU/Linux
```

## Getting started
Build the bootloader and run it in QEMU. Make sure to have `qemu` and
GNU `make` installed, and `doxygen` if you want to generate documentation.
```
$ # Run the kernel
$ make run
$
$ # Run tests
$ make run TEST=all
$ make run TEST=<testselection>
$
$ # Generate documentation
$ make docs
```

### Debugging in GDB
```
$ # Compile with debug symbols enabled and start running in QEMU.
$ # This doesn't actually start until `make gdb` is called.
$ make runi
$
$ # Start gdb and connect to the previous session, loading the debug
$ # symbols compiled from the last run to `make runi`. Make sure to
$ # run this with the same compile options (e.g., OPT=*, DEBUG=*) as
$ # in `make runi`.
$ make gdb
```
