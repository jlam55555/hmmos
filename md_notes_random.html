<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md56"></a>
asmfmt</h1>
<p>Every time I save it eats away one layer of <code>;</code> on an otherwise empty line. So if I have a line with just <code>;;;</code>, after calling <code>format-all</code> it'll become <code>;;</code>. Not that AT&amp;T syntax uses <code>;</code> anyways, but still.</p>
<p>Also, it has trouble parsing the line <code>jmp .</code> &ndash; the indentation is all messed up after that. Maybe another issue with AT&amp;T syntax.</p>
<p>For now I'll manually format my asm.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md57"></a>
Cool emacs things</h1>
<p>I just learned about <code>fill-paragraph</code> and <code>auto-fill-mode</code>. Useful for textual files (<code>*.md</code>) and prog-mode files that don't have a different formatter (or whose formatters don't care about long lines).</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md58"></a>
binutils &lt;tt&gt;-m&lt;/tt&gt; flag</h1>
<p>binutils is the package that supplies common build tools like <code>ld</code> and <code>objdump</code>. They have a funky way of specifying architectures known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_File_Descriptor_library">BFD</a>. You can mess around with this by cloning the binutils repo, running <code>./configure</code>, and then playing around with the <code>config.sub</code> script which produces a canonical BFD.</p>
<p>E.g., you can pass <code>x64</code>, <code>i386:x86</code>, <code>i386:i386</code>, and <code>i386:i386</code> to it. IIRC <code>x64</code> is a.k.a. x86_64 or Intel 64 or amd64 (but not IA64, that's Itanium), while <code>i386</code> and <code>x86</code> refer to the same thing. (To confuse things further, there's a thing referred to as IA-32e in the Intel SDM, but this is a 32-bit compatibility mode in x64_64 rather than its own architecture.)</p>
<p>What's utterly confusing is that the architectures supported by objdump's <code>-m</code> flag are different. E.g., you can specify <code>i386</code>, <code>i386</code>, but x64 is <code>i386:x86_64</code>, which doesn't make much sense to me.</p>
<p>Well, not that I'm building it in 64-bit mode now.</p>

gdb and lldb notes</h1>
<p>I'm able to do most of what I want to do (poking at registers and disassembly). There's also a <code>gui</code> command which gives you something like gdb's <code>layout</code> commands, and a <code>gdb-remote</code> command similar to gdb's remote targets. The commands feel less archaic than GDB's.</p>
<p>I find that lldb chokes when I try to step one instruction for a <code>jmp .</code> instruction, while gdb works.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md60"></a>
i8086 (real mode) support</h1>
<p>Currently GDB's <code>set architecture i8086</code> command to disassemble real-mode instructions <a href="https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=22869">seems broken</a>. (I'm using GDB 14, seems broken at least as of GDB 8.) <a href="https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu/-/issues/141#note_567553482">This workaround</a> works though.</p>
<p>This is better than lldb though, where I don't see i8086 support at all. In this case you'll need to <code>objdump</code> (if you just want to look at the disassembly) or just switch to gdb (if you need the disassembly to be correct for stepping). It doesn't seem that LLVM is popular for OSDev so I'll just accept this.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md61"></a>
clang version support</h1>
<p>I originally started out this project on a laptop running arch linux, which currently has support for LLVM 17. I tried running this on a debian bullseye (11) laptop, which only supports LLVM 11. There were a lot of issues on the older version &ndash; some of the cmdline arguments were different (for example, <code>ld.lld --oformat=binary --build_id=none</code> and <code>ld.lld --oformat=binary --build_id none</code> didn't work, but <code>ld.lld --oformat binary --build_id=none</code> did) and the linker simply did not put output sections in the right location.</p>
<p>I thought about building LLVM 17 on my own but decided to try upgrading debian first. Upgrading to bullseye (12) gives me LLVM 14, which did pretty much work OOTB (save for the fact that we lose <em>some</em> features such as new-style <code>[[ attribute ]]</code>s).</p>
<p>In terms of C++ support (which I care about, since I'm planning for the majority of the kernel to be written in C++), clang 14 <a href="https://clang.llvm.org/cxx_status.html">supports</a> the main features of C++17 and C++20 that I care about (C++17 structured bindings, C++17 CTAD, and (most of) C++20 concepts).</p>
<p>I don't currently plan to build my own cross-compiler for now since clang <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/72254698">inherently supports cross-compiling</a>, but maybe a need will arise in the future. For now enforcing clang &gt;= 14 is good enough for this project.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md62"></a>
.clangd configuration</h1>
<p>Clangd configuration is ... not the best. First of all, it's confusing. It can be configured via <code>compile_flags.txt</code>, <code>compile_commands.json</code>, and/or <code>.clangd</code>.</p>
<p>The way I understand this currently is that clangd starts by looking at the <code>.clangd</code> file (which can be in any parent directory of the file you're compiling). This will then use the <code>compile_flags.txt</code> file which contains default compilation options, or <code>compile_commands.json</code> which contains concrete compilation options for each target, in order to know which flags to compile with.</p>
<p>The problem with <code>compile_flags.txt</code> is that it's too general &ndash; this will apply to all files (you can't specify different compile flags for C vs. C++ files for example). The problem with <code>compile_commands.json</code> is that you have to generate it every time you want to use it. (Presumably you can automate this, e.g., using <a href="https://github.com/rizsotto/Bear"><code>bear</code></a>).</p>
<p>The <a href="https://clangd.llvm.org/config"><code>.clangd</code> configuration file</a> solves most of this problem. You can filter files using the <code>PathMatch:</code> predicates to filter by C/C++ files. However adding an <code>-Irelative/include/dir</code> is relative to the compiled file, not to the project root, which is <a href="https://github.com/clangd/clangd/issues/1038">inconvenient</a>.</p>

tmux vs. GNU screen</h1>
<p>tl;dr: friendship ended with <code>screen</code>. now <code>tmux</code> is my best friend.</p>
<p>I had been using <code>screen</code> as my terminal multiplexor of choice since I learned it from my mentor at Google (who had a similar emacs+screen setup). It worked ... alright up until recently, when I discovered various reasons why <code>tmux</code> seems to "just work" better OOTB. Some specific anecdotal instances (and this only from a few days of using <code>tmux</code> at work):</p>
<ul>
<li>I had a very bizarre bug at work where a program would only crash in <code>screen</code>. Turns out that it was messing with my maximum stack size &ndash; the return value of <code>ulimit -s</code> was different inside and outside <code>screen</code>.</li>
<li><code>screen</code> is very slow pasting lines. Even a few (not very long) lines can take a few seconds. I thought this was an emacs thing or something to do with long lines until I tried it in <code>tmux</code> and it's just ... as fast as you would expect pasting text to be?</li>
<li><code>tmux</code> actually has amazing integration with iTerm with its so-called <em>control mode</em>. This means the mouse just "works" with click/drag/selections for managing windows and panes. However, this seems to have been <a href="https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/453436/what-is-the-control-mode-in-tmux#comment1146454_525733">developed by the author of iTerm</a> and Linux terminal emulator support is nonexistent.</li>
<li><code>tmux</code>'s scriptability seems more modern and intuitive. <code>screen</code> is also fairly scriptable but it seems to have a more limited set of commands.</li>
<li>I've had fewer problems with using emacs in <code>tmux</code>. For example, colors were all screwed up in <code>screen</code> due to a <code>COLORTERM=truecolor</code> envvar, and comment background/foreground colors were swapped. Also, I had problems transmitting <code>M-&lt;arrowkeys&gt;</code> in <code>screen</code> but had no issue in <code>tmux</code>.</li>
<li><code>tmux</code> and <code>screen</code> sessions and windows are a little different. In <code>screen</code>, you can attach to the same session multiple times, and each instance of the session can be looking at different windows (tabs). In <code>tmux</code>, you can do this by creating new "grouped" session that shares the same windows. I.e., windows can be moved around or shared between sessions in <code>tmux</code>, which is pretty cool and seems more flexible.</li>
<li><code>tmux</code> and <code>screen</code> panes also are a bit different. In <code>screen</code> the panes are attached to a session; each pane displays one window of the session. (Multiple panes can display the same window). In <code>tmux</code> each window contains a set of one or more panes. It's also easy to navigate between panes using the <code>find-window</code> function.</li>
<li><code>tmux</code> also has the idea of servers and clients, although I haven't figured out how that works yet.</li>
</ul>
<p>Luckily, the switch was pretty seamless. Both <code>tmux</code> and <code>screen</code> use commands with an emacs-like prefix-key. I remap this to <code>C-o</code> since that doesn't conflict with my usual emacs keybindings (as <code>screen</code>'s <code>C-a</code> and <code>tmux</code>'s <code>C-b</code> both do).</p>

dinkumware</h1>
<p>I was reading about <code>std::deque</code> default block sizes and came across <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/4088999">this criticism</a> of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/1cuua7c/how_bad_is_the_dinkumware_std_implementation/">"dinkumware's" Microsoft C++ implementation</a>. The name does not inspire confidence, nor does that block size (which tries to keep to 16 bytes) &ndash; luckily this implementation has dead since C++14. </p>
